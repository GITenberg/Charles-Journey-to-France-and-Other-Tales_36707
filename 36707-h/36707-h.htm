<h2>STORY OF A JOURNEY TO FRANCE.</h2>

<p>Well, Charles, we will take a
journey. We will go to France.
We will see some of the world besides
home.</p>

<p>Bring your hat. Good-bye, Papa.
Farewell, Billy, and Harry, and every
body. We are going a great way
off. And we shall go down the lane,
and through the church-yard and by
the corner-house, and over the stile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
till we have got quite into the fields.
How pretty the fields will look! for
it will be summer days again before
we go. And there will be yellow
flowers, and white flowers, and grass,
and trees, and hedges; and the grasshoppers,
will chirp, chirp, under our
feet. Do not try to catch them; it
will only hinder us, and we have a
great way to go.</p>

<p>Pray what are those pretty creatures
that look so meek and good-natured,
and have soft thick white
wool upon their backs, like a greatcoat,
and make a noise like the little
baby when it cries? Those are sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and lambs. And what are those creatures
with horns, that are bigger than
the sheep? Some of them are black,
and some red: they make a loud
noise, but they do not look as if they
would hurt any body. Those are
cows that give milk. Stroke them.
Poor cows! stand still and look back.
Now we cannot see papa's house at
all; and we can see only the top of
the church steeple. Let us go a little
farther. Now look back. Now
we cannot see the church at all.
Farewell! We are going a great
way. Shall we ever come back again?
Yes, we shall come back again; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
we must go on now. Come, make
haste.</p>

<p>What is that tall thing that has
four great arms which move very fast?
I believe, if I was near it, they would
strike me down. It is a wind-mill.
Those arms are the sails. The wind
turns them round. And what is a
wind-mill for? It is to grind corn.
You could have no bread if the corn
were not ground. Well, but here is
a river; how shall we do to get over
it? Why, do you not see how those
ducks do? they swim over. But I
cannot swim. Then you must learn
to swim, I believe: it is too wide to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
jump over. O, here is a Bridge!
Somebody has made a bridge for us
quite over the river. That somebody
was very good, for I do not know
what we should have done without it;
and he was very clever too. I wonder
how he made it. I am sure I
could not make such a bridge.</p>

    <img src="images/p013-illus.jpg" width="350" height="266" alt="View of the river" title="" />
    <p class="caption2">Well, but here is a river.&mdash;<i>Page 12.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Well, we must go on, on, on; and
we shall see more rivers, and more
fields, and towns bigger than our town
a great deal&mdash;large towns, and fine
churches, streets, and people&mdash;more
than there is at the fair. And we
shall have a great many high hills to
climb. I believe I must get somebody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to carry the little boy up those
high hills. And sometimes we shall go
through dusty sandy roads; and sometimes
through green lanes, where we
shall hear the birds sing.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
    <a name="p016-illus.jpg" id="p016-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p016-illus.jpg" width="250" height="185" alt="A view" title="" />
</div>

<p>Sometimes we shall go over wide
commons, where we shall see no trees,
nor any house; and large heaths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
where there is hardly any grass&mdash;only
some purple flowers, and a few black
nosed little sheep. Ha! did you see
that pretty brown creature that ran
across the path? Here is another;
and look! there is another; there are
a great many. They are rabbits.
They live here, and make themselves
houses in the ground. This is a rabbit-warren.</p>

<p>Now we are come amongst a great
many trees&mdash;more trees than there
are in the orchard by a great many,
and taller trees. There is oak, and
ash, and elm. This is a wood. What
great boughs the trees have! like thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
arms. The sun cannot shine amongst
the trees, they are so thick. Look,
there is a squirrel! Jumping from
one tree to another. He is very nimble.
What a pretty tail he has!</p>

<p>Well; when we have gone on a
great many days, through a great
many fields and towns, we shall come
to a great deep water, bigger a great
many times than the river, for you
can see over the river, you know&mdash;you
can see fields on the other side;
but this is so large, and so wide, you
can see nothing but water, water, as
far as ever you can carry your eyes.
And it is not smooth, like the river;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
it is all rough, like the great pot in
the kitchen when it is boiling; and it is
so deep, it would drown you, if you
were as tall as two church steeples.
I wonder what they call this great
water? There is an old fisherman
sitting upon a stone drying himself;
for he is very wet. I think we will
ask him. Pray, fisherman, what is
this great water? It is the sea: did
you never hear of the sea? What!
is this great water the same sea that
is on our map at home? Yes, it is.
Well, this is very strange! we are
come to the sea that is in our map.
But it is very little in the map. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
can lay my finger over it. Yes; it
is little in the map, because every
thing is little in the map, the towns
are little, and the houses are little.</p>

<p>Pray, fisherman, is there any thing
on the other side of this sea? Yes;
fields, and towns, and people. Will
you go and see them? I should like
to go very well; but how must we
do to get over? for there is no bridge
here. Do not you see those great
wooden boxes that swim upon the water?
They are bigger than all papa's
house. There are tall poles in the
middle, as high as a tree. Those are
masts. See! now they are spreading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the sails. Those white sheets are the
sails. They are like wings. These
wooden boxes are like houses with
wings. Yes, and I will tell you what,
little boy! they are made on purpose
to go over the sea; and the wind
blows them along faster than a horse
can trot. What do they call them?
They call them ships. You have seen
a ship in a picture. Shall we get in?
What have those men in the ship got
on? They have jackets and trowsers
on, and checked shirts. They are
sailors. I think we will make you a
sailor; and then instead of breeches
you must have a pair of trowsers. Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
you see that sailor, how he climbs up
the ropes? He runs up like a monkey.
Now he is at the top of the
mast. How little he looks! but we
must get in. Come, make haste:
they will not stay for us. What are
you doing? picking up shells! We
must get into a boat first, because the
ship is not near enough. Now we are
in.</p>

<p>Now we are upon the great sea.
Blow, blow, wind! Sail away, ship!
There are little rooms in the ship.
Those little rooms are called cabins.
Let us walk about, and look at the
ship. Why, you cannot walk steady;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
I am afraid you are tipsy! because
the ship rolls about. But the sailors
can walk steady. The sea is not like
the river; it is greenish. Well, here
is water enough if we should be
thirsty. Yes, here is water enough;
but you would not like to drink it.
It is salt and bitter. You could not
drink it. How fast we go! Now the
fields are a great way off. Now we
cannot see any green fields at all, nor
any houses, nor any thing but the great
deep water. It is water, all round as
far as ever we can see. Yes, and sky;
we can see the sky too. All sky over
our heads, and all water every where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
round us! Do not be afraid, little
boy! blow, blow, wind! sail away,
ship! I see some things in the sea at
a great distance. Those are more
ships and boats. How very small
they are! they look like nut shells in
a great pond. O, now we are coming
to the green fields and towns on
the other side of the sea! I can see
them a little. Now I can see them
very plain. And here is a little piece
of green land, with the water running
all round it. That is an island. A
piece of land with water all round it,
is an island. But we are not going
there; we are going to the great land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>Now we are at the land. Get out
of the ship. Pray, what country is
this? This is France. France!
why France is in the map too.</p>

<p>And pray what is the name of that
country we came from, where we live,
and where papa lives? It is England.
And the deep sea is between
France and England? Yes, you
know it is so in the map.</p>

</div>

<p>O, France is a pretty place! it is
warmer than our country: and here
are pretty flowers and fine fruit, and
large grapes. I never saw such large
grapes in all my life. And the vines
grow in the fields; they do not grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
against walls, as our vines do. And
there are a great many people, men
and women, and little boys and girls,
singing, and dancing about, and so
merry! nothing can be like it. I
think we will live here, and send for
papa and Arthur. Let us go and talk
with those people. Here, you little
girl! pray give us some of your nice
fruit. <i>Serviteur Monsieur.</i> What
do you say, little girl? I do not understand
you. I cannot help that.
Here is an old man cutting vines; we
will speak to him. Pray, old man,
will you give us some of your fruit?
We are come a great way to see you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
<i>Serviteur Monsieur.</i> What do you
say? We do not know what <i>Serviteur
Monsieur</i> is. It is French.
But we do not understand French.
I cannot help that; you must go
home and learn. And why do you
speak French? Because this is
France. Did not you know that
every body speaks French in France!
Ha, ha, ha! He, he, he! Ho, ho,
ho! Here is a foolish little boy come
a great way over the sea, and does
not know that every body speaks
French in France. Ha, ha, ha! He,
he he! Ho, ho, ho! Here is a foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
little boy come a great way over
the sea, and does not know that every
body speaks French in France. Ha,
ha, ha! He, he, he! Ho, ho, ho!
Here is a foolish little boy come a
great way over the sea, and does not
know that every body speaks French
in France. Ha, ha, ha! He, he, he!
Ho, ho, ho!&mdash;What shall we do, little
boy? every body laughs at us; and
all the little birds twitter and chirp at
us. We will go home again. Farewell,
France! We will not go to France
again till papa has taught us to talk
French. Let us go into the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
again. Blow, wind, sail away ship!
Now we are got back again. Pray,
papa, teach the little boy French before
he goes a great way abroad
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE LITTLE BOY WHO WAS A COWARD.</h2>

<p>There was once a little boy, who
was a sad coward. He was afraid of
every thing almost. He was afraid
of the two kids, Nanny and Billy,
when they came and put their noses
through the pales of the court; and
he would not pluck Billy by the beard.
What a silly boy he was! Pray what
was his name? Nay, indeed, I shall
not tell you his name; for I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
ashamed of him. Well, he was much
afraid of dogs, too: he always cried if
a dog barked, and ran away, and took
hold of his mamma's apron like a
baby. What a foolish fellow he was!
for the dogs do not hurt, you know;
they love little boys and play with
them. Did you ever see a dog eat up
a little boy? No, never, I dare say.
Well; so this simple little boy was
walking by himself one day, and a
pretty black dog came out of a house,
and said, bow, wow, bow, wow; and
came to the little boy, and jumped
upon him, and wanted to play with
him; but the little boy ran away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
The dog ran after him, and cried
louder, bow, bow, wow; but he only
meant to say, Good-morrow, how do
you do? but this little boy was sadly
frightened, and ran away as fast as
ever he could, without looking before
him, and he tumbled into a very dirty
ditch, and there he lay crying at the
bottom of the ditch, for he could not
get out: and I believe he would have
laid there all day, but the dog was so
good-natured that he went to the
house where the little boy lived, on
purpose to tell them where he was.
So, when he came to the house, he
scratched at the door, and said, Bow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
wow; for he could not speak any
plainer. So they opened the door.</p>

<p>What do you want, you black dog?
We do not know you. Then the dog
went to Ralph the servant, and pulled
him by the coat, and pulled him till
he brought him to the ditch; and the
dog and Ralph together got the little
boy out of the ditch; but he was all
over mud, and quite wet, and every
body laughed at him because he was
a coward.</p>

<p>Now, Charles, my pen is tired, I
cannot write any more at present;
but if you are a good boy, perhaps I
may write you some more stories
another time. Farewell.</p>

<h2>STORIES OF DOGS.</h2>

<p>Dogs are very useful creatures,
and they are much attached to man.
Some of them will play with little
boys, will run after a ball and bring
it back to their playfellow. Spaniels
or water dogs will bring sticks which
are thrown into the water. Some
carry baskets. They do many useful
and amusing things for their masters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>There is a large house upon the
top of a mountain, in Italy, in which
a great many people live, called monks.
The house is called a convent. These
monks have a very fine breed of dogs,
called the dogs of St. Bernard. They
are a very large fine looking dog,
very strong and very bold, and yet
very kind. Not cross, like some of
the little curs, we see every day.
These dogs are trained to go down
the mountains, and if they find any
travelers, who have lost their way in
the deep snow, or who are unable to
get to the convent, these dogs help
them. One of them in ranging about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the mountain a few years ago, met
with a poor little boy, almost dead
with cold and hunger, and so benumbed
that he could not walk.</p>

    <img src="images/p051-illus.jpg" width="250" height="199" alt="A snarling dog" title="" />
</div>

<p>The dog made signs to him, so as
to make him understand, that he wanted
him to get up upon his back, which
after much trouble, the poor little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
boy did, and the dog carried him to
the convent, where he was put into a
warm bed, and taken so good care of,
that he was soon quite well.</p>

<p>All dogs, however, are not like the
good dogs of St. Bernard. Some are
very vicious. Such dogs are dangerous
animals, and certainly should not
be permitted to go unchained.</p>

    <p class="caption2">He rushed into the parlor, where all the family were at tea.<br />
    <i>Page 55.</i></p>
</div>

<p>There was an instance of great
ferocity on the part of a dog exhibited
not long since, in the streets of New
York. A horse belonging to a poor
drayman, got free from the halter
with which he was fastened, and
started for home. The drayman as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
soon as he found the horse gone, went
in pursuit and called upon the people
in the streets to stop his horse. A
bull-dog also taking the alarm pursued
the horse, and soon coming up
with him, seized the poor animal by
the upper lip. The horse, terribly
frightened, ran along several streets,
the dog all the time hanging to his lip.
At length a crowd collecting prevented
his farther progress; and to escape
being caught, and frantic with
pain and fear, he rushed into a hardware
shop, and thence into the parlor
where all the family were at tea.
After turning over the chairs and table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
they were driven back into the
shop, when every exertion was made
in vain by the owner of the horse,
and several others to release the animal
from the gripe of the tormentor.
At last one of the company with a
knife put an end to the dog's existence,
thus releasing the poor horse.</p>

<h2>STORY OF A NAUGHTY BOY.</h2>

<p>There was a naughty boy; I do
not know what his name was, but it
was not Charles, nor George, nor
Arthur, for those are all very pretty
names: but there was a robin came
in at his window one very cold morning&mdash;shiver&mdash;shiver;
and its poor little
heart was almost frozen to death.
And he would not give it the least
little crumb of bread in the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
but pulled it about by the tail, and
hurt it sadly, and it died. Now a
little while after, the naughty boy's
papa and mamma went away and left
him, and then he could get no victuals
at all, for you know he could not take
care of himself. So he went about
to every body&mdash;Pray give me something
to eat, I am very hungry. And
every body said, No, we shall give
you none, for we do not love cruel,
naughty boys. So he went about
from one place to another, till at last
he got into a thick wood of trees, for
he did not know how to find his way
any where; and then it grew dark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
quite a dark night. So he sat down
and cried sadly; and he could not get
out of the wood; and I believe the
bears came and eat him up in the
wood, for I never heard any thing
about him afterwards.</p>

<h2>STORY OF THE SILLY LAMB.</h2>

<p>I will tell you a story about a
lamb. There was once a shepherd,
who had a great many sheep and
lambs. He took a great deal of care
of them, and gave them sweet fresh
grass to eat, and clear water to drink;
and if they were sick he was very
good to them, and when they climbed
up a steep hill, and the lambs were
tired, he used to carry them in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
arms; and when they were all eating
their suppers in the field, he used to
sit upon a stile, and play them a tune,
and sing to them; and so they were
the happiest sheep and lambs in the
whole world. But every night this
shepherd used to pen them up in a
fold. Do you know what a sheepfold
is? Well, I will tell you. It
is a place like the court; but instead
of pales there are hurdles, which are
made of sticks that will bend, such
as osier twigs; and they are twisted
and made very fast, so that nothing
can creep in, and nothing can get out.
Well, and so every night, when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
grew dark and cold, the shepherd
called all his flock, sheep and lambs,
together, and drove them into the fold,
and penned them up, and there they
lay, as snug and warm and as comfortable
as could be, and nothing
could get into and hurt them, and the
dogs lay round on the outside to
guard them, and to bark if any body
came near; and in the morning the
shepherd unpenned the fold, and let
them all out again.</p>

<p>Now they were all very happy, as I
told you, and loved the shepherd dearly
that was so good to them&mdash;all except
one foolish little lamb. And this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
lamb did not like to be shut up every
night in the fold; and she came to
her mother, who was a wise old sheep,
and said to her, I wonder why we are
shut up so every night! the dogs are
not shut up, and why should we be
shut up? I think it is very hard,
and I will get away if I can, I am
resolved, for I like to run about where
I please, and I think it is very pleasant
in the woods by moonlight. Then
the old sheep said to her, you are
very silly, you little lamb, you had
better stay in the fold. The shepherd
is so good to us, that we should always
do as he bids us; and if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
wander about by yourself, I dare say
you will come to some harm. I dare
say not, said the little lamb: and so
when the evening came, and the shepherd
called them all to come into the
fold, she would not come, but crept
slily under a hedge and hid herself;
and when the rest of the lambs were
all in the fold and fast asleep, she came
out and jumped, and frisked, and
danced about; and she got out of the
field, and got into a forest full of trees,
and a very fierce wolf came rushing
out of a cave and howled very loud.
Then the silly lamb wished she had
been shut up in the fold; but the fold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
was a great way off,&mdash;and the wolf
saw her, and seized her, and carried
her away to a dismal dark den, all
covered with bones and blood; and
there the wolf had two cubs, and the
wolf said to them, Here, I have brought
you a young fat lamb&mdash;and so the
cubs took her, and growled over her a
little while, and then tore her to pieces,
and ate her up.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
